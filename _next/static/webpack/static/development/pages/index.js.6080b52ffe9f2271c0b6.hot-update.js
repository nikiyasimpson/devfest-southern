Cross platform apps are becoming common in most Enterprise environments. Companies want one app, which can supported by multiple platforms. Flutter framework by Google allows you to build one codebase and target multiple platforms without loosing the performance. In this session you will learn how to get started with Flutter. The session will also include building multiple apps showcasing session and network operations in Flutter framework. This is a very practical session with lots of live coding examples. Sit back and enjoy!\n"},{"date":"10:30 am","title":"Automated machine learning in data science - Advances and Opportunities!","id":"autoML","speakerId":"mehrdad","speaker":"Mehrdad G Shirangi","description":"Automated machine learning (autoML) has recently become a popular subject for various tech companies. Major cloud providers (Amazon AWS, Google GCP, Microsoft Azure, IBM Watson studio), each provide their own version of autoML. The basic idea is to automate various steps of a typical machine learning project, from data preprocessing, to feature selection, algorithm selection and hyper-parameter optimization. This can significantly accelerate the process of obtaining an accurate machine learning model, while potentially improving the accuracy compared with a manual process. The applications are tremendous. Researchers can now test a hypothesis within a few hours, rather than weeks, once they have obtained the data. Engineers in companies can build or maintain predictive models much more efficiently. In this talk, we consider regression and classification problems where the goal is to obtain a model with smallest generalization error. We review several recent tools and libraries for autoML and compare these tools for some datasets. We then present a demo of Google autoML. We conclude with recommendations for improving machine learning model generation process.\n"},{"date":"11:15 am","title":"Session 3","id":"css","description":"The good, bad and ugly in webapp development.\n"},{"date":"12:00 pm","title":"Lunch and Networking","id":"lunch"},{"date":"01:00 pm","title":"Codelab - Flutter","id":"flutterCodeLab"},{"date":"2:00 pm","title":"Codelab - Tensorflow","id":"tensorflowCodelab"},{"date":"3:00 pm","title":"Unlocking the hidden powers of javascript","id":"lightning"},{"date":"3:30 pm","title":"Managing the Burnout Burndown","id":"burnout"},{"date":"4:00 pm","title":"Diversity panel / Networking by WTM","id":"networking"},{"date":"4:30 pm","title":"Closing Address","id":"closing"}];
